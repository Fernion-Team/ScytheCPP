# What's ScytheCPP
ScytheCPP(stylized scy++ or ScytheC++) is the newest Scythe compiler written in C++ rather than C#.
The main focus is speed due to it running natively, instead of IL JIT.
Other focuses are writing it in a more LLVM-compatible language, so there are less issues, and it could let us add more and better features.

# When is it coming out?

Currently, we don't know what the release date could be, since it depends on a lot of variables.

What we have done and are doing right now is:

Done: <br>
  &#9;- [x] Lexer <br>
Doing: <br>
  &#9;- [] Parser <br>
  &#9;- [] Emitter <br>
  
We do expect the release date somewhere in 2023, though.

# What's the policy about editing the source code?

You can edit the code however you want, and we love contributors, just don't release your edited code for commercial purposes, and please credit us.<br>
If you do decide to contribute, please send a pull request with your edits, and we will make sure to check it out as fast as we can.
